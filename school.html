	<h1>School</h1>
	<p>I started school when I was six years old. My parents started all their kids in school when they were six instead of five. By the time I was in 8th grade the last year of middle school I already had my drivers permit and toward the end of my freshman year in high school I had my drivers license.<br><br>I attended Rock Bridge High School, In my junior year we went 100% online because of the Covid-19 pandemic. This went on through my senior year. After graduation I did two semesters at MACC (Moberly Area Community College). After that is when I transfered to the University of Missouri to study film production later changing my major to Information Technology.<br><br></p>
